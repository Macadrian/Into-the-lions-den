Lord Cereal trapped me inside this cell!
I need a key to open this door and escape.

It looks like I need a key to open this cell.
I have to take a look around.

I must be careful, there could be guards close.
They are not to catch me...

If I stay here, they can't see me.

Hey you, you are finally awake. 
You were trying to cross the border right?
Walked right into that Imperial ambush...
same as us and that thief over there.

It seems like I need another key...

Another key! This will surely be useful.
